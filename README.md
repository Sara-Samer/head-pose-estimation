# Head Pose Estimation
In this [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1aeiQp6tqTvjpx6A7yLeVCWn_QWVc71ip?usp=sharing) I try to build three models that predict the `YAW`, `PITCH` and `ROLL` angles of the head
at the start of the notebook we'll download the AFLW2000 dataset and save it to our drive
this notebook consists of two parts
1. Using dlib to predict the angles
2. Using MediaPipe to predict the angles
